The smart walking stick helps blind people to perform navigation and to do their work easily and comfortably. 
Innormal stick, the detection of the obstacle is not done and normal stick is not efficient for visually impaired persons.
Because the blind person does not know what type of things or what type of the objects come in front of him or her.
The person cannot recognize what is the size of that object and how far is he/she from the object. It is difficult for blind person to move here and there. In smart walking stick,
the object is detected and also it measures the distance between objects by using ultrasonic sensor.
If any obstacle comes in front of blind person, he/she can know about the obstacle by hearing the sound generated by the speaker. The system is
very useful for people who are visually impaired and are often
need help from others.
